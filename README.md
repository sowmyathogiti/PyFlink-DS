## Sowmya Thogiti
### Demonstration skill: 
To read a collection of numbers from 0 to 9, filter the even numbers and multiply them by 10 and finally store them in another collection using PyFlink DataStream.

### Prerequisites:
* Apache Flink Installed (2.12 or 2.11)
* IntelliJ IDE installed
* PIP installed
* Python 3.7 version installed and set in path of environment variables

### Introduction to DataStream API:  
* Apache Flink offers a DataStream API for building robust, stateful streaming applications.
* It provides fine-grained control over state and time, which allows for the implementation of advanced event-driven systems
* Flink is considered as the next-gen stream processing system.
* Flink offers substantially higher processing speeds to spark and hadoop.
* Flink provides low latency and high throughput

### How to download Flink:
* Check the versions of pip and python in terminal of IntelliJ IDE using:
    * pip --version
Flink provides low latency and high throughput    * python --version
* Once the python is of version 3.7.0, use below command to run in terminal opened in IntelliJ IDE using:
    * pip install apache-flink

### Flink set-up using python:
* Create a new file using File\New\Python file
* Provide a new name for the file such as task1.py
* In order to configure python interpreter, we need to select File\Project Structure
* in Project structure, under project settings - project SDK list - select Add sdk list - select python SDK.
* Under Add python SDk Interpreter - select Virtualenv Environment - Base interpreter--select the path of python 3.7(python.exe).
* Click OK
* Click apply and then OK again.
* After applying SDK changes, venv folder is created by default which stores all respective libraries and scripts.

### Demonstration skill:
To read a file containing sentences in each line, filter lines containing a certain word and write them to a new file

### Prerequisites:
* Apache Flink Installed (2.12 or 2.11)
* PIP installed
* IntelliJ IDE installed
* Python 3.7 version installed and set in path of environment variables

### Introduction to DataStream API:
* To develop stable, stateful streaming applications, Apache Flink offers a DataStream API.
* It provides fine-grained state and time control that enables advanced event-driven systems to be introduced.
* Flink is known as the delivery system for next-gen streams.
* For spark and hadoop, Flink provides significantly higher processing speeds.
* Flink provides low latency and high throughput.

### How to download Flink:
* Check the versions of pip and python in terminal of IntelliJ IDE using:
    * pip --version
Flink provides low latency and high throughput    * python --version
* Once the python is of version 3.7.0, use below command to run in terminal opened in IntelliJ IDE using:

### Flink set-up using python:
* Create a new file using File\New\Python file
* Provide a new name for the file such as project1.py
* We must pick File\Project Structure to configure the python interpreter.
* Under Project Structure, under Project Settings - Project SDK List - choice Add SDK List - choose Python SDK.
* Under Add python SDk Interpreter - choose Virtualenv Environment - Base Interpreterâ€”choose python 3.7 road (python.exe).
* Click OK
* Click apply and then OK again.
* The env folder is generated by default after applying SDK changes, which stores all the respective libraries and scripts.
