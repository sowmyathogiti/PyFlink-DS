### Demonstration skill: 
To read a collection of numbers from 0 to 9, filter the even numbers and multiply them by 10 and finally store them in another collection using PyFlink DataStream.

### Prerequisites:
* Apache Flink Installed (2.12 or 2.11) 
* IntelliJ IDE installed from [source](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
* PIP installed
* Python 3.7 version installed and set in path of environment variables
* pyflink installed [source](https://pypi.org/project/pyflink/)

### Introduction to DataStream API:  
* Apache Flink offers a DataStream API for building robust, stateful streaming applications.
* It provides fine-grained control over state and time, which allows for the implementation of advanced event-driven systems
* Flink is considered as the next-gen stream processing system.
* Flink offers substantially higher processing speeds to spark and hadoop.
* Flink provides low latency and high throughput

### How to download Flink:
* Check the versions of pip and python in terminal of IntelliJ IDE using:
    * pip --version
    * python --version
* Once the python is of version 3.7.0, use below command to run in terminal opened in IntelliJ IDE using:
    * pip install apache-flink
* Install pyflink using below command in terminal:
  pip install pyflink

### How to setup pyflink:
* open IntelliJ IDE and open the installed path of pyflink from file select.
* Build project from build menu.
* Run whole project and wait for all the dependencies installed into your local machine.
* Start working on pyflink projects.

### Flink set-up using python:
* Create a new file using File\New\Python file
* Provide a new name for the file such as task1.py
* In order to configure python interpreter, we need to select File\Project Structure
* in Project structure, under project settings - project SDK list - select Add sdk list - select python SDK.
* Under Add python SDk Interpreter - select Virtualenv Environment - Base interpreter--select the path of python 3.7(python.exe).
* Click OK
* Click apply and then OK again.
* After applying SDK changes, venv folder is created by default which stores all respective libraries and scripts.

### Demonstration skill: 
To read a collection of words, calculate the length of each and return a file with each line containing the word and its length using PyFlink DataStream.

### Prerequisites:
* Apache Flink Installed (2.12 or 2.11)
* PIP installed
* IntelliJ IDE installed
* Python 3.7 version installed 

### Introduction to DataStream API
* Apache Flink is an Open source stream processing framework for distributed, high performance data streaming application.
* Apache Flink offers a DataStream API for building robust, stateful streaming applications.
* It provides fine-grained control over state and time, which allows for the implementation of advanced event-driven systems.
* Flink also provides batch processing, graph processing, Itearative proccessing for Machine learning applications.
* Flink is considered as the next-gen stream processing system.
* Flink offers substantially higher processing speeds to spark and hadoop.
* Flink provides low latency and high throughput

### Installation steps of PyFlink
*  Python version (3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8) is required for PyFlink. Please run the following command to make sure that it meets the requirements:
-   $ python --version
* Check the version of pip using command:
-   $ pip --version
* Use the below command to install apache-flink 1.12.0
-  $ python -m pip install apache-flink 1.12.0
